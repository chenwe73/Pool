POOL - by: Tommy Chen

This game is a simple 2-player pool game. The rules are very basic:
- Each player take turns to shoot the cue ball.
- The user interface is controlled by the mouse. The angle of a hit is determined by the position of the mouse. The power of a hit is determined by the time that the mouse button is held down.
- 1 point is awarded for each ball (except for the cue ball) pocketed into the 4 pockets located in the corners of the table.
- 2 points are deducted for pocketing the cue ball.

Impulse Physics Engine
- The physics engine is the main focus of this project. It runs in the background as a basis for the game.
- It has a dynamic positioning system, which calculates the vectors of balls based on input forces.
- It has a rigid-body collision detection system, which checks to see if any balls have collided into each other or into a wall.
- It has a collision response system, which response to a collision detected by the collision detection system. This means that balls will bounce off other balls and walls at correct vectors.
- Friction is taken into consideration.
